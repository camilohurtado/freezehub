# FreezeHub — MVP Implementation Backlog

## Purpose

This file defines implementation order and scope for AI-assisted development.

A backlog ID is a boundary. When Claude Code is asked to implement one item, it must not silently implement later items.

Statuses:

- `TODO`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `DONE`
- `BLOCKED`

## Milestone 0 — Foundation

### FZ-001 — Repository Bootstrap
**Status:** DONE

Create the initial monorepo structure and baseline README.

Acceptance:

- `backend/`, `frontend/`, `infra/`, and `scripts/` exist.
- bootstrap documentation remains accessible.
- no unnecessary application framework code is generated.

### FZ-002 — Backend Bootstrap
**Status:** DONE

Initialize the Java/Spring Boot backend.

Acceptance:

- Java 21 project builds.
- Spring Boot application starts.
- health endpoint is available.
- baseline automated test runs.
- backend development commands are documented.

### FZ-003 — Frontend Bootstrap
**Status:** DONE

Initialize React + TypeScript frontend.

Acceptance:

- Vite application starts.
- routing foundation exists.
- baseline test/build/lint commands run.
- frontend development commands are documented.

### FZ-004 — Local PostgreSQL + Liquibase
**Status:** DONE

Introduce PostgreSQL local development and migration infrastructure.

Acceptance:

- PostgreSQL can run locally.
- backend connects through configuration/environment variables.
- Liquibase executes an initial migration.
- Testcontainers strategy is available for integration tests.

### FZ-005 — Domain Persistence Specification
**Status:** DONE

Create `docs/03-data-model.md` before implementing tenant/catalog persistence.

Acceptance:

- logical tables and relationships are documented.
- tenant-owned tables are identified.
- no speculative schema unrelated to MVP is added.

## Milestone 1 — Organization and Catalog

### FZ-010 — Security Specification
**Status:** DONE

Create `docs/06-security.md` and finalize MVP human/machine authentication approach before sensitive implementation.

### FZ-011 — Organization Foundation
**Status:** DONE

Implement the Organization tenant boundary.

### FZ-012 — User Authentication
**Status:** DONE

Implement human authentication according to `06-security.md`.

### FZ-013 — Teams
**Status:** DONE

Implement tenant-isolated team management.

### FZ-014 — Applications
**Status:** DONE

Implement tenant-isolated application management and team association.

### FZ-015 — Environments
**Status:** DONE

Implement tenant-isolated environment management.

### FZ-016 — Invite User
**Status:** DONE

**Known gap:** the real Cognito `AdminCreateUser` call is not implemented. `IdentityProvider` (`com.freezhub.shared.security`) is a port; only `LocalIdentityProvider` (fake, `local` profile) exists, mirroring `06-security.md`'s local/test JWT strategy — no real Cognito user pool exists yet (that's infrastructure work, `FZ-063`). A real `CognitoIdentityProvider` implementation must be added before this endpoint is used against a deployed environment; until then, running without the `local` profile active will fail to start (no `IdentityProvider` bean), the same fail-fast behavior as the JWT decoder.

Added during `FZ-012` (see `06-security.md`, Human Authentication): an organization's first user is admin-provisioned out-of-band; every subsequent user must be added in-product. Runs immediately after `FZ-012` in execution order, ahead of `FZ-013`.

Implement an invite endpoint restricted to `ADMINISTRATOR` users:

- Caller must be authenticated and have `role = ADMINISTRATOR` in their organization; otherwise `403`.
- Request: target email (and initial `role`, defaulting to `MEMBER`).
- Backend creates the Cognito identity (`AdminCreateUser` — Cognito emails a temporary password) and, using the returned Cognito `sub`, creates the matching `users` row scoped to the caller's `organization_id`.
- Duplicate invite (existing `users` row for that org + email) is rejected, not silently duplicated.
- Invited user's `organization_id` is always the caller's own organization — never client-supplied beyond that.

## Milestone 2 — Freeze Core

### FZ-020 — Create Change Restriction
**Status:** DONE

**Known gap (deliberately deferred out of this story):** the scope association tables reference `team`/`application`/`environment` with non-cascading foreign keys, so the database *refuses* to delete a catalog resource that a restriction references. That refusal is not yet translated into an HTTP response, so `DELETE /api/teams/{id}` (and the application/environment equivalents) on a **referenced** resource returns `500` instead of `409`. Data stays correct — the delete is genuinely refused — only the status code is wrong. Translating it to `409` needs its own story.

Scope matching semantics (OR within a dimension, AND across dimensions, empty dimension = wildcard) were specified by this story and are recorded in `01-domain.md` § Scope matching semantics. They are the contract `FZ-051` implements; no evaluation logic exists yet.

Implement creation of a scheduled deployment restriction.

Required rules:

- `startsAt < endsAt`.
- restriction cannot be entirely in the past.
- at least one scope target is required.
- scope targets belong to the authenticated organization.
- MVP type is `DEPLOYMENT_FREEZE`.
- initial status is `SCHEDULED`.

### FZ-021 — List Change Restrictions
**Status:** DONE

List restrictions for the authenticated organization with useful status filtering.

Implemented as `GET /api/restrictions`, ordered soonest-start-first (tie-broken by id, so ordering is total and results are deterministic). `?status=` may be repeated to select several states at once — `?status=SCHEDULED&status=ACTIVE` answers the product's "what is active or upcoming?" question directly. Omitting it returns every status; an unrecognised value is a `400`.

The list returns a **summary without scope**: `FZ-022` owns "retrieve a restriction and its scope". Keeping scope out of the list also keeps it to a single query regardless of row count. Adding fields later is additive and non-breaking, so `FZ-031` (dashboard) can revisit this if it needs scope inline.

The three scope collections on `ChangeRestriction` were switched from `EAGER` to `LAZY` as part of this story: `EAGER` would have made every list call issue 3N+1 queries. Verified — listing three restrictions issues one query and none against the scope tables.

### FZ-022 — Restriction Details
**Status:** DONE

Retrieve a restriction and its scope.

Implemented as `GET /api/restrictions/{id}`, returning the full representation including all three scope dimensions (unused dimensions come back as empty arrays, not null). Unknown ids and ids owned by another organization are both `404`, so cross-tenant existence is never revealed.

The scope collections are `LAZY` (see `FZ-021`) and `spring.jpa.open-in-view` is disabled, so the service initialises them explicitly inside its read-only transaction — otherwise mapping the response in the controller would fail with `LazyInitializationException`. The detail test covers this: removing the initialisation makes it fail, so the guard is real rather than incidental.

### FZ-023 — Update Scheduled Restriction
**Status:** DONE

Allow supported changes while a restriction is still scheduled.

Exact mutable fields, specified by this story:

| Editable while `SCHEDULED` | Never editable |
|---|---|
| `name`, `description`, `reason` | `id`, `organizationId`, `createdBy`, `createdAt` |
| `level` | `type` (server-controlled) |
| `startsAt`, `endsAt` | `status` (see `FZ-024`, `FZ-025`) |
| all three scope dimensions | |

Implemented as `PUT /api/restrictions/{id}` — a **full replacement**, not a partial patch. PUT avoids the null-versus-absent ambiguity a PATCH would hit on the nullable `description`: in a Java record there is no way to distinguish "field omitted" from "field explicitly set to null", so a PATCH could not express clearing a field.

Editing is permitted only while the restriction is still `SCHEDULED`; `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED` and `CANCELLED` return `409`. Once a restriction has taken effect it is a record of what happened, and editing it would rewrite history. Every creation invariant is re-checked on update, so an update can never leave a restriction in a state creation would have rejected.

`CreateRestrictionRequest` was renamed to `RestrictionRequest` and is shared by create and update: full-replacement semantics mean both carry identical fields and identical validation, and one record cannot drift out of step with itself. The shared invariant checks were likewise extracted into a single private method used by both paths.

**Deferred architectural concern — mutable aggregate vs. immutability + activity history.** Editing in place overwrites the previous state with no record that it changed or who changed it. The alternative (immutable/versioned restrictions, or an append-only change history) was raised during this story and deliberately deferred, not overlooked. `FZ-060` (Audit Events) covers part of it — recording *that* an administrative action happened — but not making the aggregate itself pristine. This deserves its own focused decision before beta; `docs/07-decisions.md` is the place to record the outcome.

### FZ-024 — Cancel Restriction
**Status:** DONE

Cancel a scheduled or active restriction according to domain rules.

Implemented as `POST /api/restrictions/{id}/cancel` — modelled as an action, not `DELETE`. Cancelling **preserves the record**: the restriction stays visible with status `CANCELLED`, because what was communicated to engineers actually happened and deleting it would erase that. `COMPLETED` and already-`CANCELLED` restrictions return `409`.

Cancellation is deliberately **not idempotent**. The backlog scopes this to "a scheduled or active restriction", and a repeat cancel means the caller believed the restriction was still live — worth surfacing rather than silently succeeding. Revisit if a machine client ever needs safe retries.

Terminality (domain invariants 5 and 6) falls out of the existing rules rather than needing new code: `FZ-023` already refuses to update anything that is not `SCHEDULED`, so a cancelled restriction can neither be edited nor moved back to `ACTIVE`. There is a test asserting exactly that.

### FZ-025 — Restriction Lifecycle
**Status:** TODO

Implement reliable transitions:

```text
SCHEDULED → ACTIVE → COMPLETED
```

and ensure cancellation prevents future activation.

Lifecycle correctness must survive application restarts.
